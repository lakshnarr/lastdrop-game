DESIGN DECISIONS & CHANGES FROM PROPOSAL
================================================================================

1. ESP32 INSTEAD OF RASPBERRY PI
   Reason: ESP32 is more compact, power-efficient, and cost-effective for 
   this application. It has built-in Bluetooth, uses less power (important 
   for portable board game), and costs significantly less (₹500 vs ₹3,500).
   ESP32 is specifically designed for IoT applications with excellent BLE 
   support.

2. GODICE INSTEAD OF REGULAR DICE
   Reason: GoDice eliminates the need for manual roll entry, making gameplay 
   smoother and faster. Automatic detection removes human error and enables 
   true wireless gameplay. The dice provide real-time battery monitoring and 
   multiple connection modes.

3. MAGNETIC COINS INSTEAD OF REAL WATER
   Reason: Using actual water in an electronics-based board game poses safety 
   risks (water + electricity). Magnetic coins with Hall sensors provide the 
   same interactive placement experience while being safe, reusable, and 
   enabling automated detection. This makes the game practical for classroom 
   and home use.

4. 20 TILES INSTEAD OF 40 CELLS
   Reason: 20 tiles provide optimal game length (15-20 minutes per game) while 
   keeping hardware complexity manageable. This reduces LED count to 80 (4 per 
   tile), lowering power consumption and cost while maintaining visual impact.

5. NATIVE ANDROID (KOTLIN) INSTEAD OF MIT APP INVENTOR
   Reason: Native Android development provides better Bluetooth reliability, 
   professional UI/UX, and advanced features like voice announcements, database 
   storage, and complex game logic. It's more suitable for a polished IoT 
   product.

6. BLE (BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY) COMMUNICATION
   Reason: BLE allows ESP32 to stay offline (no WiFi needed) while the phone 
   maintains internet connection for cloud features. This hybrid approach 
   provides local responsiveness + cloud capabilities without requiring WiFi 
   setup for the board.
